          1. Set your language goals
        </summary>
        <div>
          Setting goals brings all kinds of benefits when it comes to learning. It can help with things like motivation, self-esteem, and self-confidence. Goals also help you achieve success. For example, your ultimate long-term goal might be to have an in-depth conversation with a native speaker of your chosen language. However, to get there, you might have a medium-term goal of passing an exam, and a short-term goal of learning some specific, relevant vocabulary.</strong>

          2. Learn common vocabulary
        </summary>
        <div>
          According to some studies, native speakers know roughly 15,000 to 20,000 word families. By this, they mean a root word and all its variants. For example, speak, speaking, spoke etc. These studies suggest that by learning the most common 800 to 1,000 root words and variations, you can learn to speak a language quickly and effectively.</strong>

          3. Find a style that works for you
        </summary>
        <div>
          There are many different tools, techniques, and styles you can use when you’re learning a language. Sometimes, it can seem a little overwhelming to try and use them all. Instead, you should try a few and select the one(s) that work best for your learning style.</strong>

          4. Practice speaking
        </summary>
        <div>
          A crucial part of learning a language is being able to recognise, understand and reproduce sounds. For many language learners, concentrating on these first two aspects, as well as vocabulary and grammar, takes priority. However, this can result in a reluctance to practice speaking, which can delay your progress.</strong>

          5. Connect with a native speaker
        </summary>
        <div>
          One of the best ways to learn a language is to connect with a native speaker. Communicating with new people in your target language is often intimidating. You might be scared to make mistakes or feel that your current level isn’t good enough. However, practising with a native speaker can help you quickly improve your language skills.</strong>

          6. Consume media
           </summary>
        <div>
          To get familiar with the different ways in which people use your target language, you might want to consider watching, reading, and listening to as much media in that language as possible. There are so many mediums you can choose from this. Whether it’s watching TV and movies in your target language, listening to music and radio, or reading the news, you have plenty of options.</strong>

          7. Engage with the culture
        </summary>
        <div>
          Tips six and seven are somewhat related. Understanding the culture(s) that use the language you’re learning is often an integral part of the learning process. As well as providing a solid context for your studies, it also means that you can better connect with native speakers.</strong>
